## TODO:

- [ ] Write a proper README.md
- [x] Implement references search
- [ ] Implement base types\inheritors search
- [ ] Implement incoming calls
- [ ] Implement type hierarchy
- [x] Add tabs and multisearch
- [x] Auto-expand first result in tree view
- [x] Preserve expanded state and selected element after rebuilding the tree and switching between results
- [x] Display proper loading states
    - [x] Fix the issue when 'loading' is shown when there are no results
- [ ] Commands and keybindings to switch between tabs\navigate\etc.
- [x] Add an ability to navigate to a single result directly
    - [x] Probably add status bar item 'waiting for sync navigation: 1.7s...'
    - [ ] Ignore the item under caret? (TS support always return the symbol itself + usages. Especially bad if no real usages)
- [ ] Add reuse of search results:
    - [ ] Overwrite last item if it was not used (no clicks, no navigation)
    - [ ] Go back to the existing result if search is on the same location and no changes happened
- [ ] Implement editor highlightings
- [ ] Add an option to show a quickpick instead of tabs (with an option to switch to the tree view)
- [x] Add an optional grouping by the directory
- [x] Add an optional grouping by the member
- [x] Fix the issue when other trees are not getting rebuild when grouping changed while they were invisible
- [ ] Grouping by member looks strange when we are searching 'implementations': member is in fact the result (but what if it's a method parameter that looks extremely alike?)
- [ ] Add an optional grouping by write\read usages (custom API required)
- [x] ~~Add an ability to type in results to filter them~~ - F3!!!
- [x] Add counter "N result(s)" to each item in a tree
- [x] Use better icons to display the grouping state
- [ ] Cancel search if tab is closed before it finishes
- [x] Can't switch tab when long "loading results" is in progress
- [ ] `'get' usages` when searching for property usages 🗿
- [x] View is not hidden after "Restart extensions"
- [ ] Check, can we relax the vscode version requirement
